Here are the places WinNUT Creates registry entries:

\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WinNUT
It has a subkey "upsmon"
This key has the following values
REG_SZ		ConfigurationFilePath	Location of the configuration file (typically upsmon.conf)
REG_SZ		ExeFilePath		Location of the actual WinNUT Executable (WinNutUpsMon.exe)
REG_SZ		LogFilePath		Location of the log file
REG_DWORD	LogMask			bitmask that specifies what levels get logged
REG_DWORD	Port			Default port on which upsd should be contacted
REG_DWORD	ShutdownType		The extra part of the mask (besides EWX_SHUTDOWN to use - like EWX_FORCE or EWX_FORCEIFHUNG)

For Windows 9x:
\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\WinNutUPSMon
This key has one value that specifies the ExeFilePath
This is only set if automatic startup is selected under win9x

For Windows NT:
\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinNutUPSMon
This is the definition of the service (if you have install as service selected)
Most of the keys in here are created automatically by the api that creates a service entry.
A couple of them however are extra - including
REG_SZ		DESCRIPTION		This is the text that describes the service - this is used under the 2000 Service panel - not sure if this is used under NT

\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\WinNutUPSMon
Also for any NT installation, the following values are put under this key so that we can log
events under the NT Event Log
REG_SZ 		EventMessageFile		This key specifies the location of the WinNutUpsMon executable
REG_SZ 		CategoryMessageFile		This key specifies the location of the WinNutUpsMon executable
REG_SZ 		ParameterMessageFile		This key specifies the location of the WinNutUpsMon executable
REG_DWORD	TypesSupported			This is always set to 0x7
