WinNUT Installer created with 

Inno Setup - available at www.innosetup.com
	The actual setup compiler application.  It is available free of charge at their site. 
	See their site for specific licence details.
	Inno Setup is copyrighted software, not public domain software. 
	There are some restrictions on distribution and use.

ISTool - www.istool.org
	A excellent GUI that generates the Inno Setup files
	I've not seen a license file for the ISTool, but it is currently available for 
	download without any apparent restrictions.

Special thanks to Aaron Yourk for pointing me to these tools and giving me an installer to start with.


Once all files are compiled copy the following files to a installFiles subfolder
